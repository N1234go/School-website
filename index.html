        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> The Institution - if the word can rightly describe, the dream and the intention of evolving a pious, humble and righteous race of mankind was founded on 21st July 1980 with a meager strength of 70. It was started by Sri Sathya Sai Trust, M.P. and has ever since been a non profit, non proprietary education body.

It is widely recognized for its progressive approach and commitment to excellence. Distinction and diversity are the twin marks of its philosophy, educational leadership and scholarly achievement is its mission. Strong in tradition it has evolved as a matrix of networking between a number of schools governed by Sri Sathya Sai Central Trust, Prashanthi Nilayam. Today, it holds the capacity of 2500 student who stand a class apart in the society. We have never been inclined towards having a magnificent infrastructure, though it genuinely and naturally took its magnanimity as it is today, over the course of time.

Our interest has always been in the awakening of the self willed power of the divine within a student. Sri Sathya Sai Vidya Vihar, on completion of more than 25 illuminating years, can proudly claim to have played a pivotal role in transforming young students and creating a community of distinguished individuals.</p>
